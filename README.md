📊 Data Analytics — From Basics to Advanced (Including AI, ML & DL)
🚀 Overview

Data Analytics is the process of collecting, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing raw data to discover meaningful insights, support decision-making, and predict future trends. It combines statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to convert data into actionable intelligence.

With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), modern data analytics has evolved into a dynamic ecosystem of tools, techniques, and frameworks designed to handle large-scale, real-time, and complex data.

🧩 Levels of Data Analytics
Level	Type	Description	Example
1️⃣	Descriptive Analytics	Understand what has happened in the past using historical data.	Monthly sales reports, dashboards
2️⃣	Diagnostic Analytics	Analyze why something happened by finding correlations and patterns.	Identifying causes of customer churn
3️⃣	Predictive Analytics	Use statistical models and ML to predict future outcomes.	Forecasting revenue, predicting stock prices
4️⃣	Prescriptive Analytics	Suggest the best actions using simulations and optimization algorithms.	Recommending marketing strategies
5️⃣	Cognitive/AI-Driven Analytics	Apply AI and DL for automation and intelligent decision-making.	Chatbots, intelligent assistants
🧠 Core Concepts

Data Collection → Gathering data from databases, APIs, sensors, or web scraping.

Data Cleaning → Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Data Transformation → Normalizing, encoding, or aggregating data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Using statistics and visualization to understand data.

Feature Engineering → Creating and selecting relevant variables for ML models.

Model Building → Applying ML/DL algorithms to find patterns or make predictions.

Data Visualization → Presenting results in dashboards or reports for decision-making.
